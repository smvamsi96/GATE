T minus 304 days.

Syllabus is Huge.
I cannot listen to those lectures directly.
Too meaningless.
I need to understand those subjects by reading books myself.
This takes time.

These are the courses I need to Complete, in this order:

-Theory of Computation:
	I think I can handle this without any books.

-Operating Systems:
	Should start with books

-Computer Networks

-Compiler Design

-Digital Logic Design

-Computer Organization & Architecture

-Database Management System

-Algorithms

-Data Structures

-C Programming

-Math
	Math's mostly familiar.
	Will start after December(within 2 months of GATE)

-Aptitude
	what Math said


THE PLAN

In the spirit of Parallel Processing,

- Read as much as you can about,
	- Operating Systems
	- Computer Networks
	- Algorithms & Data Structures
